Duplicate `require` Statements\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n// ...\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n```\n**Issue**: The `express` module is required twice. This is redundant and should be removed.\n\n**Suggestion**: Delete the second `require` statement for `express`.\n\n### 2. Port Inconsistency\n```javascript\nconst port = 5002;\n// ...\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log(\"Server running on port 3000\"));\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n**Issue**: The application is set to listen on two different ports (3000 and 5002). This will cause an error as a port can only be used by one instance at a time.\n\n**Suggestion**: Remove one of the `app.listen` calls. Consider using only the `port` variable to avoid hardcoding.\n\n### 3. MongoDB Connection String\n```javascript\nmongoose.connect(\"mongodb://localhost/blog\", { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n```\n**Issue**: The connection string is hardcoded, which can be problematic for different environments.\n\n**Suggestion**: Move the MongoDB connection URI to an environment variable for better flexibility and security.\n\n### 4. Error Handling in Routes\n```javascript\napp.post(\"/blog\", (req, res) => {\n  // ...\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  // ...\n});\n```\n**Issue**: Current error handling just logs to the console. This does not inform the client about the error.\n\n**Suggestion**: Send a response with an appropriate HTTP status code and error message in case of an error.\n\n### 5. Use of `body-parser` Middleware\n**Issue**: Express 4.16+ has built-in body-parsing middleware. The use of `body-parser` is redundant.\n\n**Suggestion**: Replace `body-parser` middleware with `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.\n\n### 6. Inconsistent Response for Delete Operation\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/blog/:id\", (req, res) => {\n  // ...\n  res.status(200).send();\n});\n```\n**Issue**: The response for the delete operation is just an HTTP status. It might be better to have a consistent response format.\n\n**Suggestion**: Consider sending a JSON response similar to other routes, e.g., `{ message: \"Blog post deleted successfully\" }`.\n\n### 7. Logging for Server Startup\n**Issue**: There are two log statements for server startup, which could be confusing.\n\n**Suggestion**: Consolidate into a single, clear log statement indicating the server is running and on which port.\n\n---\n\nOverall, the code sets a good foundation for a blog API. Addressing the above points would enhance its robustness, maintainability, and readability.\n"
